# ipynb-zenburn
A Jupyter Notebook stylesheet based on [zenburn] (https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn).

To use this style (on a Mac), download and rename `ipynb-zenburn.css` file to `custom.css` and place in the directory `~/.ipython/profile_default/custom/custom/`. Then it should automatically load when you start up Jupyter Notebook.

Place the file `zenburn_plotstyle.py` and put it in the directory `~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/`. This will make your plots match the stylesheet of the browser:
